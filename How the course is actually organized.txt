- First part

Various people presenting topics of different kinds; they are usually part of SPRITZ group or 
just talks held by international people (such as from other universities, etc.)

- Second part

Us students selecting a topic in a list of papers/topics given to choose (there, we find three papers, we 
do the presentation on the first one and another seconday one)
We make the groups ourselves (only 1 student/2 students/3 students) subscribing to a Google Form

Here we will also be evaluated for "provoking questions":
- we have to make (according to rules) two questions for lesson (not on same topic, can vary)
- you just tell your name/surname (only surname, if hearable/understandable) and ask the questions,
teaching assistants will note it
- you can also do unscripted questions, with same reasoning as rule above

In reality:
- the questions done in presence are considered as bonus basically; teaching assistants look
at questions sent in form and you will get evaluated anyway; as said, in some lessons,
probably you wouldn't even get noticed and make questions, so no worries

- Third part

The SPRITZ members will propose a series of ideas, and we will have to choose one of them
between projects of all themes (similar to the ones of presentations, such as ML, Communication, Jamming, 
Network Security, Vehicles, Biometrics, Cyberphysical systems, etc.)
- we will have to make an essay on a selected project and topic, writing an email to Conti and assistants
asking for approval of the topic or a feedback
- if they say yes, then the project should be delivered up until 24 hours before an exam date
- if the project you want to do is not part of selected topics, you will have again to write to Conti 
and teaching assistants proposing your idea; it can be approved anyway, but it's not guaranteed
