- First part

Various people presenting topics of different kinds

- Second part

Us students selecting a topic in a list of papers/topics given to choose (there, we find three papers, we 
do the presentation on the first one and another seconday one)
We make the groups ourselves (only 1 student/2 students/3 students) subscribing to a Google Form

Here we will also be evaluated for "provoking questions":
- we have to make (according to rules) two questions for lesson (not on same topic, can vary)
- you just tell your name/surname (only surname, if hearable/understandable) and ask the questions,
teaching assistants will note it
- you can also do unscripted questions, with same reasoning as rule above
