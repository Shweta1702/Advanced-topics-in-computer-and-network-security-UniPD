SLIDE 1: Application fields for PINs
- ATMs, PoS, unlock smartphones, smart bank, etc..
- explain why PINs security is an essential factor

SLIDE 2: Focus on ATMs and PoS PINs (section 2)
- Problem of information leakage in:
	- Non-acoustic Side-channels
	- Acoustic Side-channels
- Goal of the paper: combine audio feedbacks with observable information to deduce a PIN

SLIDE 3: Adversary Models (section 3)
- Inter-keystroke timings 
- Single or Multi-finger typists 
- Information about the first or the last digit of the PIN 
- Which keys have been pressed

SLIDE 4: PIN inference from inter-keystroke timings (section 4.2)
- Extraction of inter-keystroke timings
- Inter-key distance vector

SLIDE 5: PIN inference from inter-keystroke timings + victim typing behavior (section 4.3)
- How the added source improve attacks

SLIDE 6: PIN inference from information about the first or the last digit of the PIN (section 4.4)
- How the added source improve attacks

SLIDE 7: PIN inference from knowledge of which keys have been pressed (section 4.5)
- How the added source improve attacks

SLIDE 8: paper 1 conclusions (section 5 + 6)
- PINs and their guessing probability distribution

SLIDE 9: Focus on smartphone PINs (section 1 + 2)
- Problem of usability and security
- Why PIN selection policies are so important

SLIDE 10: Actual distribution of the real world PINs (section 3)
- Occurrence frequency of the PINs
- PINs generated from dates and years
- PINs generated through arithmetic operations
- PINs with close proximity

SLIDE 11: Online survey to examine the effectiveness of PIN selection (section 4)
- Participants
- Methodology: choose PINs over 5 different PIN selection policies
- Feedback on how many chosen PINs were easy to remember

SLIDE 12: paper 2 conclusions (section 5)
- Percentual of participants who should change their chosen PINs over the 5 different PIN selection policies
